# Introduction to Computer Vision using Python

Here is some material for a three-hour workshop to introduce Python users to Computer Vision. I am making the assumption that you have used Python before but that you are new to computer vision.

Computer vision is a bunch of techniques we use to teach computers to "see". You can use computer vision for a wide variety of applications. Some of these applications make the world a better place and other applications make it worse. I hope you use computer vision to make people's lives better.
